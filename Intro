  <p>I was born here in the <span class="univ">Viet Nam</span>. And i came to the United State in 2010. I came here when i was 10, after i came to the <span class="univ">US</span> i finished my 5th grade here. And i don't know anything due to lack of English. I attended 6-12 grade here. </p>
  <p>Soon after I came to the US I went to a summer english tutor at a church for new immigrant like me. Did learn some history along with other thing over here, i do some reading during my break time and listening to music. After the first years in high school i chose to enter the Computer Science Academy at school and from there i have interested into Computer Science. Thought out my college timeline i learn that Computere Science is not somthing simple and easy there are many different type of computer science topic and stuff. And i was facing alot of problem and issues thought this timeline and i know taht if you want to be in this industry you have to put more efford then other to get what you want.</p>
